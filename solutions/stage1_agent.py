"""Build Your First AI Agent - your starting point (Stage 1: the baseline agent).

This is the whole agent. It has three parts:
  1. a MODEL      - Claude Sonnet 4.5, running on Amazon Bedrock
  2. a SYSTEM PROMPT - the standing instructions that shape how it answers
  3. a RUN step   - we hand it the patient's question and print the answer

Run it:   python agent.py

Right now the model answers from training data alone - no access to real,
current clinical trials. Notice how vague (and sometimes made-up) the answer is.
Over the next two stages you'll fix that: Stage 2 grounds it in a Knowledge Base
of real trials, and Stage 3 lets it call the live ClinicalTrials.gov API.
